# GMIT Programming & Scripting Repository

## Purpose

This repository contains the code for the weekly exercises from the Programming and Scripting module from the GMIT HDip in the science of data analytics. 
All code in this repository is written in [Python](http://python.org).



* **Week 1 - week-1-exercise.py - This code was written by Dr Ian McLoughlin**  
Instrunctions:  In the video lectures this week we ran an example program that calculated the 30th Fibonacci number. Change the program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on. For example, my name is Ian, so I should calculate the 25th Fibonacci number because I is 9 and n is 14, giving 25 in total. Once you calculate the right Fibonacci number for your own name, please post it to the Discussions forum on this page as per my post there.

* **Week 2 - "week-2-exercise" - This code was written by Dr Ian McLoughlin
Displays Fibonacci numbers using people's names**  
Instructions: Change the program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on. For example, my name is Ian, so I should calculate the 25th Fibonacci number because I is 9 and n is 14, giving 25 in total. Once you calculate the right Fibonacci number for your own name, please post it to the Discussions forum on this page as per my post there.

* **Week 3 - "week-3-exercise.py"  
Collatz conjecture program**  
Instructions: Complete the exercise discussed in the Collatz conjecture video by writing a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. You can specify in your code the starting value of 17. If you wish to enhance your program, have the program ask the user for the integer instead of specifying a value at the start of your code. Add the script to your GitHub repository, as per the instruction in the Assessments section.

* **Week 4 - "exercise-4.py"  
Project Euler Problem 5**   
Instructions: 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

* **Week 5 - "exercise-5-iris-data" directory  
Parse CSV data from .csv file**  
Instructions: Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.

* **Week 6 - "exercise-6.py"  
Get factorial of number**  
Instructions: Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.
