# GMIT Programming & Scripting Repository

## Purpose

This repository contains the code for the weekly exercises from the Programming and Scripting module from the GMIT HDip in the science of data analytics. 
All code in this repository is written in [Python](http://python.org).



* Week 1  
This code was written by Dr Ian McLoughlin

* Week 2 - "week-2-exercise"  
Displays Fibonacci numbers using people's names

* Week 3 - "week-3-exercise.py"  
Collatz conjecture program

* Week 4 - "exercise-4.py"  
Project Euler Problem 5   
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

* Week 5 - "exercise-5-iris-data" directory  
Parse CSV data from .csv file

* Week 6 - "exercise-6.py"  
Get factorial of number
Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.
